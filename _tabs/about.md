My name is Pablo, and I am an information security enthusiast with a solid background in full-stack development and a proactive approach towards learning. I currently work as a Security Consultant, but I previously spent 4 years as a Software Developer. My passion for computer security has led me to participate in various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, and I'm proud to have earned a spot in the top 50 of the Hack The Box Hall of Fame.

This blog serves as my personal notepad to refer to when I need to look up a command, methodology, or source code. The goal is to provide a resource that is not only useful to me but also to others who share my interest in information security and software development.

Please feel free to use and share anything you come across here, as I hope it will be beneficial to you as well.
